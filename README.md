STM32L476DISCOVERY PROJECTS
====================

## A Step-By-Step Introduction to Software Development for the STM32L476G Discovery Board

    TBD: To be done
    TBT: To be tested

### 01-Blinker-Crude

A very simple blinker using instruction counting to generate delay.

### 02-Blinker-Simple

The same as the previous one, but using symbols. Delay is, as before, generated by instruction counting.

### 03-Blinker-using-macros

The same as the previous one, but using macros to manipulate bits and bitfields. Delay is  still generated by instruction counting.

### 04-Blinker-using-HAL-for-GPIO

Using a GPIO HAL to blink LEDS. Delay is  still generated by instruction counting.

### 05-Blinker-with-reusable-HAL-for-GPIO

The GPIO HAL is implementated in separated files, one for the implementation (gpio.c) and another for the interface (gpio.h) Delay is  still generated by instruction counting.

### 06-Blinker-with-Systick

Blinking using a time interrupt.

### 07-Blink-with-HAL-for-LEDs

Using a HAL to control LEDS, without GPIO HAL. 

### 08-Joystick-controls-blinking

Modifying the blinking frequency using the joystick. Joystick interface is a pooled one.


### 09-Joystick-using-polling

Modifying the blinking frequency using the joystick. Joystick interface is a pooled one.
But the center point is read too.

### 10-Joystick-using-interrupts

Modifying the blinking frequency using the joystick. Joystick interface is a interrupt based one.

### 11-Blinker-with-State-Machine-and-Interrupts

Using a state machine, time interrupts, joystick to control blinking.

### 12-Blinker-with-Interrupts

The same as before but using predefined symbols in manufacturer header file.

### 13-Joystick-with-HAL-for-Joystick

Interface routines to Joystick.

### 14-Using-UART-with-Polling

UART interface using polling.

### 15-Using-UART-with-Interrupts-TBT

UART interface with interrupts.

### 16-Newlib-TBT

Implementing Newlib, by emulating a POSIX interface.

### 17-TimeTriggered

Using a time triggered executive as found in Pattern on Time Triggered Embedded System of Michael Pont. 

### 18-TimeTriggered-v2

Using a better version of executive as found in Engineering Reliable Embedded System.

### 19-Protothreads

Using Protothreads as in [Protothreads](http://dunkels.com/adam/pt/)

### 20-Rios

Using the Rios as in [RIOS](https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~vahid/rios/)


### 21-SST

Using the SST as in  [Build a Super Simple Tasker](https://www.embedded.com/build-a-super-simple-tasker/)

### 22-WatchDog-TBT

Testing the watchdog.

### 23-FreeRTOS

Blink LEDs with FreeRTOS.

### 24-ucos2-TBT

Blink LEDs with ucos2.

### 25-ucos3-TBT

Blink LEDs with ucos3.

### 26-Using-the-LCD

Driving the LCD.

### 27-Getting-Temperature

Using the internal temperature sensor to get and show temperature.
